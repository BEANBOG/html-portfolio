<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm just a Gamer who had a knack for programming and wanted to create a Career<br />
  out of it. I've been programming since 2019 when I chose my College Career as<br />
  a Game Developer. I was the typical acting programmer on the projects I've <br />
  worked on and I'm proud to say that I fully embraced that role as a Career.
